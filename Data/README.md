1. Download data from https://star.cs.ucr.edu as "Full Dataset" for each, and not one of the cached alternative format versions. These files can be kept in an `originals` folder, both the compressed `bz2` files and the uncompressed versions.
2. Data preprocessed with wkt_preprocessor_clean.py to remove indices and metadata columns, only keeping geometry data to bring into compliance with GOES WKT parsers. These I would append the extension `.wkt` to.
3. Each data file can be split with terminal command: `split -d -a 1 -n l/8 datafile.wkt datafile_split/` after creating subfolder `datafile_split`. This creates files named `0`, `1`, etc. in the subfolder.
4. Now the files are prepared to run with `mpirun -np 1 geos_benchmark_mpi.out ../Data/file1_split/ ../Data/file2_split/ 1` where the first `1` can be replaced with number of processes, and the second `1` with number of times to repeat the test. Notice the slashes at the end of the path names given to the program; this is because the program expects to append a number. This would also work if files were named `file1.wkt0`, etc., though you'd have to use `..Data/file1_split/file1.wkt` instead as the first path, and change the second similarly.
