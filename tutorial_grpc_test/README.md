# Instructions

This project is designed to use an installed version of gRPC as a library, rather than by including its source code within this project.

For getting and testing a local install of gRPC such that this project can work:

https://grpc.io/docs/languages/cpp/quickstart/

For running this project, those same instructions can work. Only, rather than running their examples/cpp/helloworld within the gRPC install files, change into this project's directory and follow the same idea.
